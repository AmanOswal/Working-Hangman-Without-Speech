# Working-Hangman-Without-Speech
Using tkinter, I create an interactive hangman. The hangman uses much lesser clicks then other hangmans to get going. Try it out!
This project was the first step for creating a speech functionality Hangman.
Special thanks to https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/build-hangman-in-python and https://github.com/Lavakumar999/Python-Tkinter-FrameWork/tree/master/hangman for the code and images.
